    "Step 00 is the first and most important part of feature engineering. In this step a database is used that contains the information for the training and testing datasets. In this case, the data being used is news articles that were gathered from the BBC. These articles are either classified as business, entertainment, politics, sport, or tech. This is essentially supervised learning which was discussed in class as being a machine learning method where the training dataset and labels are provided. The overall goal of the machine learning models is to create a model that when presented with a news article, be able to classify the news article based on the content in the article.\n",

    "The next step of text classification is the exploratory data analysis step. This step uses the datasets created in the previous step. This involves loading the dataset as a Dataframe. The first major part of this step is to create a bar chart that shows how many different types of articles there are for each category. In this case, there are 510 business articles, 386 entertainment articles, 417 politics articles, 511 sports articles, and 401 tech articles. The next step is then to graph the percentage of articles which shows 22.9% are business, 17.3% entertainment, 18.7% are politics, 23.0% are sport, and 18.0% are tech [2]. Overall, this shows that the number of articles is a large amount which contains approximately an equal amount of data in each class. This is important as large datasets are necessary when training a model otherwise it may results in misclassification of the testing data. Also, an equal amount of each class is useful in order to properly train the model to recognize each class.\n",
    "After the dataset has been analyzed, the next step is find the length of each of the news articles and then plot that value. Through this plot, it can be seen that the range of the lengths of news articles is between 0 and 5000 characters. Afterwards a box plot is used to show the lengths of each article for each category. The result shows that there is not much difference between the lengths for each article in each category. This is also an important part of classification as an article that is too big could outweighs other articles that may be significantly smaller. This new dataset is then saved as a pickle file.\n",

    "# Step 03\n",
    "Step 03 is the feature engineering step of this process in which. These steps are text cleaning and preparation, label coding, train-test split, and text representation. The first part is the text cleaning and preparation. In order to do this the overall dataset is used which contains the news articles. There are several characters which are present in the articles which do not need to be used for classification. These characters were determined to be “\\r,\\n,\\, “. Each of these characters are present in the article but are only present due to the way python interprets text. In order to represent the text correctly, each of these characters need to be replaced with the correct spacing. This is done in the 1.1 Special Character Cleaning Step. Afterwards is the 1.2 Upcase\\downcase step which focuses on changing uppercase letters to the lowercase forms. This is done in order to avoid confusion on whether an uppercase word is the same as the lowercase word. Next is 1.3 Punctuation signs which is a step where any punctuation marks such as “.” or “!” are removed since the model will only look at the words used to classify the article. This reduces the amount of information that will need to be considered by the model. Next would be step 1.4 Possessive Pronouns. This step removes the apostrophe s that comes at the end of possessive words. This turns the words from “the dog’s ball” to just “the dog ball”. Again this is a similar step to step 1.3 as the apostrophe is not necessary for classification. The next step that is performed is 1.5 Stemming and Lemmatization which is used to reduce words to a simpler form such as reducing the word cars to just car. This is an example of stemming where the end of the word is removed to reduce the word to a more basic form. Lemmatization however is the simplification based on the word itself. In this activity, lemmatization was used instead of stemming. Lastly is Step 1.6 Stop Words in which the stop words are removed from the text. In this activity, the stop words are “'i', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'we', 'our', 'ours', 'ourselves', 'you', \"you're\"”. These words are also unnecessary for classification as they do not contain any information about the content of the article.\n",
    "After this is done each of the possible classes are translated to a numerical value, which are 0,1,2,3,4. Each article is assigned a value based on the category of that article. The next step is to split the dataset into a training and testing dataset. This was discussed in class as a dataset will need to be used to train the model whereas a different dataset will need to be used to test the model. Afterwards text representation occurs. In this step of the activity, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is used as the main features. In TF-IDF, the frequency of words is converted to a feature vector. After doing this, it was found that unigrams or single elements from a sequence matched the predicted category accurately. However, bigrams or two elements from a sequence did not match the predicted category very well. After doing this step, the next step is model training.\n",

       "'Self-driving vehicles are steadily becoming a reality despite the many hurdles still to be overcome â€“ and they could change our world in some unexpected ways.\\nI\\n\\nIt\\'s a late night in the Metro area of Phoenix, Arizona. Under the artificial glare of street lamps, a car can be seen slowly approaching. Active sensors on the vehicle radiate a low hum. A green and blue \\'W\\' glows from the windscreen, giving off just enough light to see inside â€“ to a completely empty driver seat.\\n\\nThe wheel navigates the curb steadily, parking as an arrival notification pings on the phone of the person waiting for it. When they open the door to climb inside, a voice greets them over the vehicle\\'s sound system. \"Good evening, this car is all yours â€“ with no one upfront,\" it says.\\n\\nThis is a Waymo One robotaxi, hailed just 10 minutes ago using an app. The open use of this service to the public, slowly expanding across the US, is one of the many developments signalling that driverless technology is truly becoming a part of our lives.\\n\\nThe promise of driverless technology has long been enticing. It has the potential to transform our experience of commuting and long journeys, take people out of high-risk working environments and streamline our industries. It\\'s key to helping us build the cities of the future, where our reliance and relationship with cars are redefined â€“ lowering carbon emissions and paving the way for more sustainable ways of living. And it could make our travel safer. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. \"We want safer roads and less fatalities. Automation ultimately could provide that,\" says Camilla Fowler, head of automated transport for the UK\\'s Transport Research Laboratory (TRL).\\n\\nBut in order for driverless technology to become mainstream, much still needs to change. \\n\\n\"Driverless vehicles should be a very calm and serene way of getting from A to B. But not every human driver around it will be behaving in that way,\" says David Hynd, chief scientist for safety and investigations at TRL. \"It\\'s got to be able to cope with human drivers speeding, for instance, or breaking the rules of the road.\"\\n\\nAnd that\\'s not the only challenge. There\\'s regulation, rethinking the highway code, public perception, improving the infrastructure of our streets, towns, cities, and the big question of ultimate liability for road accidents. \"The whole insurance industry is looking into how they\\'re going to deal with that change from a person being responsible and in charge to the vehicle doing that,\" says Richard Jinks, vice president of commercial at Oxfordshire-based driverless vehicle software company Oxbotica, which has been testing its technology in cars and delivery vehicles at several locations across the UK and Europe. \\n\\nThe ultimate vision experts are working towards is of completely driverless vehicles, both within industry, wider transport networks, and personal-use cars, that can be deployed and used anywhere and everywhere around the world.\\nMcity puts driverless cars through their paces in an environment that mimics a real city, complete with crossing pedestrians (Credit: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nMcity puts driverless cars through their paces in an environment that mimics a real city, complete with crossing pedestrians (Credit: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nBut with all these hurdles in place, what exactly does the next 10 years have in store for autonomous vehicles?\\n\\nTwo years from now\\n\\nThe biggest hurdle for those in the driverless technology industry is how to get the cars to operate safely and effectively in complex and unpredictable human environments. Cracking this part of the puzzle will be the major focus of the next two years.\\n\\nAt the Mcity Test Facility at the University of Michigan, experts are addressing this. The world\\'s first purpose-built testing ground for autonomous vehicles, it\\'s a mini-town of sorts, made up of 16 acres of road and traffic infrastructure. It includes traffic signals and signs, underpasses, building facades, tree cover, home and garage exterior for testing delivery and ride-hailing, and different terrains such as road, pedestrian walkways, railway tracks, and road-markings which the vehicles must navigate. It\\'s here that experts test scenarios that even the most experienced of drivers may be pressed to handle, from children playing in the street to two cars trying to merge on a junction at the same time.\\nChange Agents\\n\\nWe know the world has to change for humanity to thrive. But what are the most promising solutions that could provide the kind of transformation we need? In a world adjusting to the recent global pandemic, Change Agents examines innovations and technologies that could make our planet a better, healthier place to live.\\n\\n\"In order to test driverless technology like this, it depends on hundreds of different variables in any given situation,\" explains Necmiye Ozay, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Michigan. Her solution is to create a group of varied thinkers.\\n\\n\"We\\'re trying to bring people from different parts of the university â€“ not only engineers, but we have people from across disciplines such as psychology, more human-machine-interaction type people, because there are lots of angles to this problem we are trying to solve when it comes to safety,\" says Ozay. In the facility, Ozay and her team can test different traffic scenarios, as well as explore how autonomous vehicles communicate with each other yet keep vehicle and personal data secure from hackers.\\n\\nThat self-driving taxis are already on the roads in Phoenix, Arizona, is due to a prolonged testing process like the one Ozay\\'s team is conducting. Currently only available as a test service to the public in small defined areas, in the next two years there are plans to release the taxis on a greater and wider scale. For example, US-based company Waymo is currently rolling out to new city test sites that could very realistically see robotaxis operational in San Francisco and New York by 2023. But their co-chief executive Tekedra Mawakana was cautious to say what further roll out of its service there might be, and where, because \"safety takes time\".\\n\\nAutoX, a start-up funded by Alibaba, launched its fully driverless RoboTaxi in Shanghai, China in 2020. By 2023 it\\'s likely their service will be available in other cities across China, as well as in California.\\n\\nMuch of the driverless technology already in use exists in industrial settings like mines, warehouses, and ports, but Hynd believes in the next two years we can expect to see this extended to \"last mile delivery\". This means the final part of a journey for goods and services â€“ the point at which they are delivered to the consumer. For example, autonomous HGV trucks on motorways or even delivery vehicles for products and groceries.\\n\\nFive years from now\\n\\nWhile Apple says it is aiming to launch fully self-driving electric cars four years from now, industry experts are more cautious about what the near-future holds.\\n\\nAccording to Fowler, the conversation around regulation and insurance companies\\' new role within this transport space needs to mature. \"It\\'s got to be a very iterative approach where we\\'re starting with pods and shuttles, or we\\'re starting with off-highway vehicles where you can see such a benefit, and you\\'ve got a more controlled environment potentially, and what works with that,\" she says. \"Then we can scale it up and across more vehicle types, more use cases.\"\\nAutonomous shuttles, such as these in Iserlohn, Germany, could help to link passengers on public transport to other parts of a city (Credit: Alamy)\\n\\nAutonomous shuttles, such as these in Iserlohn, Germany, could help to link passengers on public transport to other parts of a city (Credit: Alamy)\\n\\nOne new space we can expect to see driverless technology deployed in is high-risk environments, from nuclear plants to military settings, to limit the dangers to human life, says Fowler. A Rio Tinto mine in Western Australia, for example, is currently operating the largest autonomous fleet in the world. The trucks are controlled by a centralised system miles away in Perth.\\n\\n\"If you can take people out of that and you can have vehicles that are driving themselves, and are fully automated even, if you\\'ve got somebody who\\'s remotely needing to control that vehicle in that high-risk environment then that\\'s got to be good,\" says Fowler.\\n\\nIn the next five years most driverless technology will remain behind the scenes. TRL is investigating the potential for driverless HGVs on motorways, including the idea of platooning vehicles. Platoons are a group of semi-autonomous vehicles that drive a close distance between each other, stopping other vehicles from separating them. By driving closer together, vehicles in a platoon can be more fuel efficient by taking advantage of the slipstream of the truck in front while also helping to reduce congestion as the lorries take up less overall space on the road. Also in this space is Plus, the first self-driving truck manufacturer, whose European pilots commenced this year after a successful trial on Wufengshan highway in China\\'s Yangtze Delta economic centre.\\n\\nYou might also like:\\n\\n    The internet behemoth you\\'ve never heard of\\n    The technology to end traffic jams\\n    How Google\\'s balloons surprised their creators\\n\\nAway from these industries, Ozay further predicts that \"we will possibly see lighter robotic vehicles that can potentially use sidewalks and bike paths with limited speeds â€“ for delivering things such as food and groceries.\"\\n\\nWhen it comes to public transport, Oxbotica is also working with German-based vehicle systems specialist ZF over the next five years to make the driverless shuttle a true mainstay for European cities, operating on roads, as well as at airports, much in the same way buses do now. \"The shuttles in airports we see today on rails won\\'t need those rails in five years from now. This means driverless shuttles have the potential to transport you from the car park to the airport, then straight through to your gate and the plane,\" Jinks explains.\\n\\n    My hope is that cars will be smart enough to say \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' when asked if they can reliably and safely get a non-driver from point A to point B on a given day â€“ Necmiye Ozay\\n\\nFor users, this could mean more reliable and cost-efficient transport systems. \"Interlinking autonomous transport systems to bring a public transport system that is as efficient as you jumping in your own car and driving it yourself has got to be the answer to congestion in the future,\" adds Jinks.\\n\\nSeven years from now\\n\\nAll experts agree that the next seven years will depend on the successes and failures of initial deployments, and how safety and public trust evolves accordingly. However, most hope that city redesigns will enable more adoption of the technology and help move us into modern, and more efficient ways of living. \"If you live in a dense, urban area, the hope is that you\\'d be able to rely on mobility as a service. You could dial up the car, it would arrive in two minutes, and you make your journey. You wouldn\\'t need to have those vast rows of parked cars in your street, which makes the street more navigable for the automated vehicle,\" says Hynd.\\n\\nWithout parked cars lining the street, roads could be narrower, making way for more green spaces. But while proponents of self-driving vehicles insist they will make our roads safer, there are some who feel pedestrians and autonomous vehicles simply can\\'t mix.

       "'Self-driving vehicles are steadily becoming a reality despite the many hurdles still to be overcome â€“ and they could change our world in some unexpected ways. I  It\\'s a late night in the Metro area of Phoenix, Arizona. Under the artificial glare of street lamps, a car can be seen slowly approaching. Active sensors on the vehicle radiate a low hum. A green and blue \\'W\\' glows from the windscreen, giving off just enough light to see inside â€“ to a completely empty driver seat.  The wheel navigates the curb steadily, parking as an arrival notification pings on the phone of the person waiting for it. When they open the door to climb inside, a voice greets them over the vehicle\\'s sound system. \"Good evening, this car is all yours â€“ with no one upfront,\" it says.  This is a Waymo One robotaxi, hailed just 10 minutes ago using an app. The open use of this service to the public, slowly expanding across the US, is one of the many developments signalling that driverless technology is truly becoming a part of our lives.  The promise of driverless technology has long been enticing. It has the potential to transform our experience of commuting and long journeys, take people out of high-risk working environments and streamline our industries. It\\'s key to helping us build the cities of the future, where our reliance and relationship with cars are redefined â€“ lowering carbon emissions and paving the way for more sustainable ways of living. And it could make our travel safer. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. \"We want safer roads and less fatalities. Automation ultimately could provide that,\" says Camilla Fowler, head of automated transport for the UK\\'s Transport Research Laboratory (TRL).  But in order for driverless technology to become mainstream, much still needs to change.   \"Driverless vehicles should be a very calm and serene way of getting from A to B. But not every human driver around it will be behaving in that way,\" says David Hynd, chief scientist for safety and investigations at TRL. \"It\\'s got to be able to cope with human drivers speeding, for instance, or breaking the rules of the road.\"  And that\\'s not the only challenge. There\\'s regulation, rethinking the highway code, public perception, improving the infrastructure of our streets, towns, cities, and the big question of ultimate liability for road accidents. \"The whole insurance industry is looking into how they\\'re going to deal with that change from a person being responsible and in charge to the vehicle doing that,\" says Richard Jinks, vice president of commercial at Oxfordshire-based driverless vehicle software company Oxbotica, which has been testing its technology in cars and delivery vehicles at several locations across the UK and Europe.   The ultimate vision experts are working towards is of completely driverless vehicles, both within industry, wider transport networks, and personal-use cars, that can be deployed and used anywhere and everywhere around the world.

Two years from now  The biggest hurdle for those in the driverless technology industry is how to get the cars to operate safely and effectively in complex and unpredictable human environments. Cracking this part of the puzzle will be the major focus of the next two years.  At the Mcity Test Facility at the University of Michigan, experts are addressing this. The world\\'s first purpose-built testing ground for autonomous vehicles, it\\'s a mini-town of sorts, made up of 16 acres of road and traffic infrastructure. It includes traffic signals and signs, underpasses, building facades, tree cover, home and garage exterior for testing delivery and ride-hailing, and different terrains such as road, pedestrian walkways, railway tracks, and road-markings which the vehicles must navigate. It\\'s here that experts test scenarios that even the most experienced of drivers may be pressed to handle, from children playing in the street to two cars trying to merge on a junction at the same time. Change Agents  We know the world has to change for humanity to thrive. But what are the most promising solutions that could provide the kind of transformation we need? In a world adjusting to the recent global pandemic, Change Agents examines innovations and technologies that could make our planet a better, healthier place to live.  \"In order to test driverless technology like this, it depends on hundreds of different variables in any given situation,\" explains Necmiye Ozay, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Michigan. Her solution is to create a group of varied thinkers.  \"We\\'re trying to bring people from different parts of the university â€“ not only engineers, but we have people from across disciplines such as psychology, more human-machine-interaction type people, because there are lots of angles to this problem we are trying to solve when it comes to safety,\" says Ozay. In the facility, Ozay and her team can test different traffic scenarios, as well as explore how autonomous vehicles communicate with each other yet keep vehicle and personal data secure from hackers.  That self-driving taxis are already on the roads in Phoenix, Arizona, is due to a prolonged testing process like the one Ozay\\'s team is conducting. Currently only available as a test service to the public in small defined areas, in the next two years there are plans to release the taxis on a greater and wider scale. For example, US-based company Waymo is currently rolling out to new city test sites that could very realistically see robotaxis operational in San Francisco and New York by 2023. But their co-chief executive Tekedra Mawakana was cautious to say what further roll out of its service there might be, and where, because \"safety takes time\".  AutoX, a start-up funded by Alibaba, launched its fully driverless RoboTaxi in Shanghai, China in 2020. By 2023 it\\'s likely their service will be available in other cities across China, as well as in California.  Much of the driverless technology already in use exists in industrial settings like mines, warehouses, and ports, but Hynd believes in the next two years we can expect to see this extended to \"last mile delivery\". This means the final part of a journey for goods and services â€“ the point at which they are delivered to the consumer. For example, autonomous HGV trucks on motorways or even delivery vehicles for products and groceries.  Five years from now  While Apple says it is aiming to launch fully self-driving electric cars four years from now, industry experts are more cautious about what the near-future holds.  According to Fowler, the conversation around regulation and insurance companies\\' new role within this transport space needs to mature. \"It\\'s got to be a very iterative approach where we\\'re starting with pods and shuttles, or we\\'re starting with off-highway vehicles where you can see such a benefit, and you\\'ve got a more controlled environment potentially, and what works with that,\" she says. \"Then we can scale it up and across more vehicle types, more use cases.\" Autonomous shuttles, such as these in Iserlohn, Germany, could help to link passengers on public transport to other parts of a city (Credit: Alamy)  Autonomous shuttles, such as these in Iserlohn, Germany, could help to link passengers on public transport to other parts of a city (Credit: Alamy)  One new space we can expect to see driverless technology deployed in is high-risk environments, from nuclear plants to military settings, to limit the dangers to human life, says Fowler. A Rio Tinto mine in Western Australia, for example, is currently operating the largest autonomous fleet in the world. The trucks are controlled by a centralised system miles away in Perth.  \"If you can take people out of that and you can have vehicles that are driving themselves, and are fully automated even, if you\\'ve got somebody who\\'s remotely needing to control that vehicle in that high-risk environment then that\\'s got to be good,\" says Fowler.  In the next five years most driverless technology will remain behind the scenes. TRL is investigating the potential for driverless HGVs on motorways, including the idea of platooning vehicles. Platoons are a group of semi-autonomous vehicles that drive a close distance between each other, stopping other vehicles from separating them. By driving closer together, vehicles in a platoon can be more fuel efficient by taking advantage of the slipstream of the truck in front while also helping to reduce congestion as the lorries take up less overall space on the road. Also in this space is Plus, the first self-driving truck manufacturer, whose European pilots commenced this year after a successful trial on Wufengshan highway in China\\'s Yangtze Delta economic centre.  You might also like:   The internet behemoth you\\'ve never heard of  The technology to end traffic jams  How Google\\'s balloons surprised their creators  Away from these industries, Ozay further predicts that \"we will possibly see lighter robotic vehicles that can potentially use sidewalks and bike paths with limited speeds â€“ for delivering things such as food and groceries.\"  When it comes to public transport, Oxbotica is also working with German-based vehicle systems specialist ZF over the next five years to make the driverless shuttle a true mainstay for European cities, operating on roads, as well as at airports, much in the same way buses do now. \"The shuttles in airports we see today on rails won\\'t need those rails in five years from now. This means driverless shuttles have the potential to transport you from the car park to the airport, then straight through to your gate and the plane,\" Jinks explains.   My hope is that cars will be smart enough to say \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' when asked if they can reliably and safely get a non-driver from point A to point B on a given day â€“ Necmiye Ozay  For users, this could mean more reliable and cost-efficient transport systems. \"Interlinking autonomous transport systems to bring a public transport system that is as efficient as you jumping in your own car and driving it yourself has got to be the answer to congestion in the future,\" adds Jinks.  Seven years from now  All experts agree that the next seven years will depend on the successes and failures of initial deployments, and how safety and public trust evolves accordingly. However, most hope that city redesigns will enable more adoption of the technology and help move us into modern, and more efficient ways of living. \"If you live in a dense, urban area, the hope is that you\\'d be able to rely on mobility as a service. You could dial up the car, it would arrive in two minutes, and you make your journey. You wouldn\\'t need to have those vast rows of parked cars in your street, which makes the street more navigable for the automated vehicle,\" says Hynd.  Without parked cars lining the street, roads could be narrower, making way for more green spaces. But while proponents of self-driving vehicles insist they will make our roads safer, there are some who feel pedestrians and autonomous vehicles simply can\\'t mix. It could mean that our cities and the way we use them may need to be reimagined.  Some of this thinking is already taking place. In 2018, IKEA developed a concept autonomous vehicle that can double up as meeting rooms, hotels, and stores.

driverless technology industry is how to get the cars to operate safely and effectively in complex and unpredictable human environments cracking this part of the puzzle will be the major focus of the next two years  at the mcity test facility at the university of michigan experts are addressing this the world\\'s first purposebuilt testing ground for autonomous vehicles it\\'s a minitown of sorts made up of 16 acres of road and traffic infrastructure it includes traffic signals and signs underpasses building facades tree cover home and garage exterior for testing delivery and ridehailing and different terrains such as road pedestrian walkways railway tracks and roadmarkings which the vehicles must navigate it\\'s here that experts test scenarios that even the most experienced of drivers may be pressed to handle from children playing in the street to two cars trying to merge on a junction at the same time change agents  we know the world has to change for humanity to thrive but what are the most promising solutions that could provide the kind of transformation we need in a world adjusting to the recent global pandemic change agents examines innovations and technologies that could make our planet a better healthier place to live  \"in order to test driverless technology like this it depends on hundreds of different variables in any given situation\" explains necmiye ozay associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university of michigan her solution is to create a group of varied thinkers  \"we\\'re trying to bring people from different parts of the university â€“ not only engineers but we have people from across disciplines such as psychology more humanmachineinteraction type people because there are lots of angles to this problem we are trying to solve when it comes to safety\" says ozay in the facility ozay and her team can test different traffic scenarios as well as explore how autonomous vehicles communicate with each other yet keep vehicle and personal data secure from hackers  that selfdriving taxis are already on the roads in phoenix arizona is due to a prolonged testing process like the one ozay\\'s team is conducting currently only available as a test service to the public in small defined areas in the next two years there are plans to release the taxis on a greater and wider scale for example usbased company waymo is currently rolling out to new city test sites that could very realistically see robotaxis operational in san francisco and new york by 2023 but their cochief executive tekedra mawakana was cautious to say what further roll out of its service there might be and where because \"safety takes time\"  autox a startup funded by alibaba launched its fully driverless robotaxi in shanghai china in 2020 by 2023 it\\'s likely their service will be available in other cities across china as well as in california  much of the driverless technology already in use exists in industrial settings like mines warehouses and ports but hynd believes in the next two years we can expect to see this extended to \"last mile delivery\" this means the final part of a journey for goods and services â€“ the point at which they are delivered to the consumer for example autonomous hgv trucks on motorways or even delivery vehicles for products and groceries  five years from now  while apple says it is aiming to launch fully selfdriving electric cars four years from now industry experts are more cautious about what the nearfuture holds  according to fowler the conversation around regulation and insurance companies\\' new role within this transport space needs to mature \"it\\'s got to be a very iterative approach where we\\'re starting with pods and shuttles or we\\'re starting with offhighway vehicles where you can see such a benefit and you\\'ve got a more controlled environment potentially and what works with that\" she says \"then we can scale it up and across more vehicle types more use cases\" autonomous shuttles such as these in iserlohn germany could help to link passengers on public transport to other parts of a city (credit alamy)  autonomous shuttles such as these in iserlohn germany could help to link passengers on public transport to other parts of a city (credit alamy)  one new space we can expect to see driverless technology deployed in is highrisk environments from nuclear plants to military settings to limit the dangers to human life says fowler a rio tinto mine in western australia for example is currently operating the largest autonomous fleet in the world the trucks are controlled by a centralised system miles away in perth  \"if you can take people out of that and you can have vehicles that are driving themselves and are fully automated even if you\\'ve got somebody who\\'s remotely needing to control that vehicle in that highrisk environment then that\\'s got to be good\" says fowler  in the next five years most driverless technology will remain behind the scenes trl is investigating the potential for driverless hgvs on motorways including the idea of platooning vehicles platoons are a group of semiautonomous vehicles that drive a close distance between each other stopping other vehicles from separating them by driving closer together vehicles in a platoon can be more fuel efficient by taking advantage of the slipstream of the truck in front while also helping to reduce congestion as the lorries take up less overall space on the road also in this space is plus the first selfdriving truck manufacturer whose

potentially use sidewalks and bike paths with limited speeds â€“ for delivering things such as food and groceries\"  when it comes to public transport oxbotica is also working with germanbased vehicle systems specialist zf over the next five years to make the driverless shuttle a true mainstay for european cities operating on roads as well as at airports much in the same way buses do now \"the shuttles in airports we see today on rails won\\'t need those rails in five years from now this means driverless shuttles have the potential to transport you from the car park to the airport then straight through to your gate and the plane\" jinks explains   my hope is that cars will be smart enough to say \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' when asked if they can reliably and safely get a nondriver from point a to point b on a given day â€“ necmiye ozay  for users this could mean more reliable and costefficient transport systems \"interlinking autonomous transport systems to bring a public transport system that is as efficient as you jumping in your own car and driving it yourself has got to be the answer to congestion in the future\" adds jinks  seven years from now  all experts agree that the next seven years will depend on the successes and failures of initial deployments and how safety and public trust evolves accordingly however most hope that city redesigns will enable more adoption of the technology and help move us into modern and more efficient ways of living \"if you live in a dense urban area the hope is that you\\'d be able to rely on mobility as a service you could dial up the car it would arrive in two minutes and you make your journey you wouldn\\'t need to have those vast rows of parked cars in your street which makes the street more navigable for the automated vehicle\" says hynd  without parked cars lining the street roads could be narrower making way for more green spaces but while proponents of selfdriving vehicles insist they will make our roads safer there are some who feel pedestrians and autonomous vehicles simply can\\'t mix it could mean that our cities and the way we use them may need to be reimagined  some of this thinking is already taking place in 2018 ikea developed a concept autonomous vehicle that can double up as meeting rooms hotels and stores the impact this type of innovation would have is reduced requirement for travel in the first place offering instead interchangeable ondemand environments as and when we need them our needs could be met right where we are  ozay expects many more selfdriving options to be available for customers during this time including in the passenger vehicle space \"my hope is that cars will be smart enough to say \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' when asked if they can reliably and safely get a nondriver from point a to point b on a given day by analysing the weather and traffic conditions beforehand\" she explains  10 years from now  despite all the developments and innovations the next decade is likely to hold some experts still feel we might be a way off from full deployment of driverless vehicles by 2031 \"fullself driving â€“ humanlevel or above in all possible conditions where you can put kids by themselves in the car to send them to arbitrary locations without worrying â€“ is not something i expect to see\" says ozay once commuters can let their cars take over the driving completely

driverless technology have long be entice it have the potential to transform our experience of commute and long journey take people out of highrisk work environments and streamline our industries it key to help us build the cities of the future where our reliance and relationship with cars be redefine â€“ lower carbon emissions and pave the way for more sustainable ways of live and it could make our travel safer the world health organization estimate that more than 13 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crash \"we want safer roads and less fatalities automation ultimately could provide that\" say camilla fowler head of automate transport for the uk transport research laboratory (trl)  but in order for driverless technology to become mainstream much still need to change   \"driverless vehicles should be a very calm and serene way of get from a to b but not every human driver around it will be behave in that way\" say david hynd chief scientist for safety and investigations at trl \"it get to be able to cope with human drivers speed for instance or break the rule of the road\"  and that not the only challenge there regulation rethink the highway code public perception improve the infrastructure of our streets towns cities and the big question of ultimate liability for road accidents \"the whole insurance industry be look into how they\\'re go to deal with that change from a person be responsible and in charge to the vehicle do that\" say richard jinks vice president of commercial at oxfordshirebased driverless vehicle software company oxbotica which have be test its technology in cars and delivery vehicles at several locations across the uk and europe   the ultimate vision experts be work towards be of completely driverless vehicles both within industry wider transport network and personaluse cars that can be deploy and use anywhere and everywhere around the world mcity put driverless cars through their pace in an environment that mimic a real city complete with cross pedestrians (credit jeff kowalsky/afp/getty images)  mcity put driverless cars through their pace in an environment that mimic a real city complete with cross pedestrians (credit jeff kowalsky/afp/getty images)  but with all these hurdle in place what exactly do the next 10 years have in store for autonomous vehicles  two years from now  the biggest hurdle for those in the driverless technology industry be how to get the cars to operate safely and effectively in complex and unpredictable human environments crack this part of the puzzle will be the major focus of the next two years  at the mcity test facility at the university of michigan experts be address this the world first purposebuilt test grind for autonomous vehicles it a minitown of sort make up of 16 acres of road and traffic infrastructure it include traffic signal and sign underpasses build facades tree cover home and garage exterior for test delivery and ridehailing and different terrains such as road pedestrian walkways railway track and roadmarkings which the vehicles must navigate it here that experts test scenarios that even the most experience of drivers may be press to handle from children play in the street to two cars try to merge on a junction at the same time change agents  we know the world have to change for humanity to thrive but what be the most promise solutions that could provide the kind of transformation we need in a world adjust to the recent global pandemic change agents examine innovations and technologies that could make our planet a better healthier place to live  \"in order to test driverless technology like this it depend on hundreds of different variables in any give situation\" explain necmiye ozay associate professor of electrical and computer engineer at the university of michigan her solution be to create a group of vary thinkers  \"we\\'re try to bring people from different part of the university â€“ not only engineer but we have people from across discipline such as psychology more humanmachineinteraction type people because there be lot of angle to this problem we be try to solve when it come to safety\" say ozay in the facility ozay and her team can test different traffic scenarios as well as explore how autonomous vehicles communicate with each other yet keep vehicle and personal data secure from hackers  that selfdriving taxis be already on the roads in phoenix arizona be due to a prolong test process like the one ozay team be conduct currently only available as a test service to the public in small define areas in the next two years there be plan to release the taxis on a greater and wider scale for example usbased company waymo be currently roll out to new city test sit that could very realistically see robotaxis operational in san francisco and new york by 2023 but their cochief executive tekedra mawakana be cautious to say what further roll out of its service there might be and where because \"safety take time\"  autox a startup fund by alibaba launch its fully driverless robotaxi in shanghai china in 2020 by 2023 it likely their service will be available in other cities across china as well as in california  much of the driverless technology already in use exist in industrial settings like mine warehouse and port but hynd believe in the next two years we can expect to see this extend to \"last mile delivery\" this mean the final part of a journey for goods and service â€“ the point at which they be deliver to the consumer for example autonomous hgv truck on motorways or even delivery vehicles for products and groceries  five years from now  while apple say it be aim to launch fully selfdriving electric cars four years from now industry experts be more cautious about what the nearfuture hold  accord to fowler the conversation around regulation and insurance companies\\' new role within this transport space need to mature \"it get to be a very iterative approach where we\\'re start with pod and shuttle or we\\'re start with offhighway vehicles where you can see such a benefit and you\\'ve get a more control environment potentially and what work with that\" she say \"then we can scale it up and across more vehicle type more use cases\" autonomous shuttle such as these in iserlohn germany could help to link passengers on public transport to other part of a city (credit alamy)  autonomous shuttle such as these in iserlohn germany could help to link passengers on public transport to other part of a city (credit alamy)  one new space we can expect to see driverless technology deploy in be highrisk environments from nuclear plant to military settings to limit the dangers to human life say fowler a rio tinto mine in western australia for example be currently operate the largest autonomous fleet in the world the truck be control by a centralise system miles away in perth  \"if you can take people out of that and you can have vehicles that be drive themselves and be fully automate even if you\\'ve get somebody who remotely need to control that vehicle in that highrisk environment then that get to be good\" say fowler  in the next five years most driverless technology will remain behind the scenes trl be investigate the potential for driverless hgvs on motorways include the idea of platooning vehicles platoons be a group of semiautonomous vehicles that drive a close distance between each other stop other vehicles from separate them by drive closer together vehicles in a platoon can be more fuel efficient by take advantage of the slipstream of the truck in front while also help to reduce congestion as the lorries take up less overall space on the road also in this space be plus the first selfdriving truck manufacturer whose european pilot commence this year after a successful trial on wufengshan highway in china yangtze delta economic centre  you might also like   the internet behemoth you\\'ve never hear of  the technology to end traffic jam  how google balloon surprise their creators  away from these industries ozay further predict that \"we will possibly see lighter robotic vehicles that can potentially use sidewalks and bike paths with limit speed â€“ for deliver things such as food and groceries\"  when it come to public transport oxbotica be also work with germanbased vehicle systems specialist zf over the next five years to make the driverless shuttle a true mainstay for european cities operate on roads as well as at airports much in the same way bus do now \"the shuttle in airports we see today on rail won\\'t need those rail in five years from now this mean driverless shuttle have the potential to transport you from the car park to the airport then straight through to your gate and the plane\" jinks explain   my hope be that cars will be smart enough to say \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' when ask if they can reliably and safely get a nondriver from point a to point b on a give day â€“ necmiye ozay  for users this could mean more reliable and costefficient transport systems \"interlinking autonomous transport systems to bring a public transport system that be as efficient as you jump in your own car and drive it yourself have get to be the answer to congestion in the future\" add jinks  seven years from now  all experts agree that the next seven years will depend on the successes and failures of initial deployments and how safety and public trust evolve accordingly however most hope that city redesign will enable more adoption of the technology and help move us into modern and more efficient ways of live \"if you live in a dense urban area the hope be that you\\'d be able to rely on mobility as a service you could dial up the car it would arrive in two minutes and you make your journey you wouldn\\'t need to have those vast row of park cars in your street which make the street more navigable for the automate vehicle\" say hynd  without park cars line the street roads could be narrower make way for more green space but while proponents of selfdriving vehicles insist they will make our roads safer there be some who feel pedestrians and autonomous vehicles simply can\\'t mix it could mean that our cities and the way we use them may need to be reimagined  some of this think be already take place in 2018 ikea develop a concept autonomous vehicle that can double up as meet room hotels and store the impact this type of innovation would have be reduce requirement for travel in the first place offer instead interchangeable ondemand environments as and when we need them our need could be meet right where we be  ozay expect many more selfdriving options to be available for customers during this time include in the passenger vehicle space \"my hope be that cars will be smart enough to say \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' when ask if they can reliably and safely get a nondriver from point a to point b on a give day by analyse the weather and traffic condition beforehand\" she explain  10 years from now  despite all the developments and innovations the next decade be likely to hold some experts still feel we might be a way off from full deployment of driverless vehicles by 2031 \"fullself drive â€“ humanlevel or above in all possible condition where you can put kid by themselves in the car to send them to arbitrary locations without worry â€“ be not something i expect to see\" say ozay once commuters can let their cars take over the drive completely will it free them up for new kinds of productivity and activities (credit thomas lohnes/afp/getty images)  once commuters can let their cars take over the drive completely will it free them up for new kinds of productivity and activities (credit thomas lohnes/afp/getty images)  hynd agree that full automation be unlikely on this timescale \"with anything transport infrastructure anything that society use so many other things need to come into play and i don\\'t just mean regulation\" he say safety will be a major hurdle especially for countries slower to adopt the change because of the huge cost involve infrastructure will also dictate how fast and effectively this technology can roll out and public perception and willingness to use autonomous vehicles will need to increase accord to hynd  but not everyone agree jinks be confident that we\\'ll see autonomous vehicles on the roads at the same time as humandriven vehicles in 10 years from now in this vein you may very well be step onto a driverless shuttle at the airport then into a selfdriving taxi to take you to your final destination  own a driverless car in the next 10 years be less likely â€“ it\\'ll still be too expensive for most people accord to hynd but the promise of driverless technology be about unchain us from our reliance on cars and how that can transform the use of our time and our environment  \"this be one of the biggest engineer problems that we\\'re try to solve in a century\" jinks say \"it will be an evolution over time from less complex environments and capabilities to more complex to everywhere it a continuum and think about that continuum it will keep improve over time these things will continuously learn from each other\"  much in the same way that electric charge station have slowly enter car park side streets and service station so too will autonomous vehicles eventually make their way into our everyday worlds years from now we may well be wonder how we ever live without them'"
